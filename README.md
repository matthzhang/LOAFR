# LOAFR File Analysis
LOAFR is a system designed using Agile development techniques to import, read, analyze, and display
data from a .csv file. This system offers users a variety of functions to better view their data.
Three main functions implmented include sort, filter, and search. Import files must follow strict
formatting guidelines in order for LOAFR to successfully read and import data. Test files have been
included with examples of such guidelines.
